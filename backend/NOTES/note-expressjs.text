First Express.js API
-time to get to the real deal

***Why Express???
-more convenient solution
-if we manage to build same thing over and over again or kindly simillar, we should create a package/a tool which can be apply when we face that task(e.g create a server in node)
-EXPRESS IS THE MOST POPULAR BACKEND FRAMEWORK FOR JAVASCRIPT


***Introduction to Express
http://expressjs.com/ 
-first thing we need to do is to init project using npm:    npm init -y
-second thing:  npm install express
-create a file 'server.js' and start server with command: npm start ; of course after you set your app and PORT in the file



***Express vs Next.js vs Koa

***Route Parameters
-An example of how express make our lifes easier (create a list of friends that we can get by ID)



***Postman and Insomnia 
https://www.postman.com/ 
https://insomnia.rest/

Postman is a collaboration for API testing.

API Client
Automated testing
Design & Mock
Documentation for API
Monitors API
Workspaces - share with your team

Insomnia is a tool to help design and debug APIs.

Easier interface ans usability



***Development Dependencies!!!

-is getting tired restarting server over and over after every change
-we can install instal 'nodemon' for doing this when we have a change:  npm install nodemon --save-dev  =>nodemon is placed under dependencies section in json and another section
-also add the script :   "watch": "nodemon server.js"
-to start type : npm run watch



***Middleware
-it allows u to add feature to ur server using requests and responses to/from API
-are special functions that run between or in the middle of request coming in API and the response coming out API
-how Middleware functions look like:  (same with others but it has a different parameter added: next)

app.use(function(req, res, next) {
})

***Writing Our Own Logging Middleware
look in the code 'server.js', than you have to run the url in postman and get result in console



***POST Requests in Express
-create an endpoint to get a new friend and add to our collection
!!!- in express we have a build in function that understand when a request is being passed as a json   ->   express.json([])

-create function in the file 'server.js' and in POSTMAN create a new requeste, type POST, url and in the body -> set to raw -> set to JSON and write the object below
{
    'name': 'example'
}
after you send request you will see below the json object that was created 



***Model View Controller(MVC)
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller

-MVC is a software design pattern commonly used for developing user interfaces that divides the related program logic into three interconnected elements. This is done to 
separate internal representations of informations from the ways information is presented to and accepted from the user.
